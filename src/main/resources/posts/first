# Undestanding **frog** (by doing something else)

I will try to write a function to convert a bit-stream (in the form of a string) to its representation as an IPv4 address.

The catch is, the code must be as concise as possible.

## Let's try Scala!

Scala can be very concise and yet readable with some nicely written chains of operations. Let's see it in action here:

```scala
  def toIp(str: String) =
     str.grouped(8)
        .map(el => Integer.parseInt(el, 2))
        .mkString(".")
```

The `grouped(n)` method is defined for all the members of `scala.collection.IterableLike` which `String` is a member of. But let's not get too involved.

What it does is given "123456" return an iterator with the contents grouped every `nth` character, i.e if n is 2 then we get `("12", "34", "56")` which is perfect for this job.

All we have to do then, is map each one to its decimal representation and be done with it.

Now we can just say

```scala
  @ toIp("10000000000010100000001000011110")
  res1: String = "128.10.2.30"
```

## Let's try Python!

The best way I could come up with, without making and import, is this

```python
  def to_ip(bitstr):
    lst = [bitstr[i:i+8] for i in range(0, len(bitstr), 8)]
    res = [str(int(i, 2)) for i in lst]
    return '.'.join(res)
```

and then you can simply call

```python
  >>> print(to_ip("10000000000010100000001000011110"))
  128.10.2.30
```

But one would argue that python is no good without the imports. And I agree, so let's try the same thing, but now with the help of an import.

```python
  import re
  def to_ip2(bitstr):
    return '.'.join([str(int(i, 2)) for i in re.findall('........?', bitstr)])
```

so now we can call it again and get the expected results

```python
  >>> print(to_ip2("10000000000010100000001000011110"))
  128.10.2.30
```

This is quite concise but it becomes difficult to read.

The classic readability/conciseness problem.

I would argue that it is much clearer in Scala, without giving way to less conciseness.
